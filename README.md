## Articles used to create this project

Eventually, I have decided to use the Content Delivery API of Contantful to fetch and query data for the project, but for some time I was experimenting with the Contentful GraphQL Content API.

The following articles provided me with the information to make the best decision for the project:

[Paginating your Contentful blog posts in Next.js with the GraphQL API](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2021/04/23/paginating-contentful-blogposts-with-nextjs-graphql-api/)
